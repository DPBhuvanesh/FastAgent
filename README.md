# FastAgent

**FastAgent** is an intelligent backend orchestration system designed to streamline database management and data analysis through agentic workflows. Built using **FastMCP** and the **Google Agent ADK**, the platform serves as a sophisticated bridge between Large Language Models and backend infrastructure. 

By utilizing a high-performance **Model Context Protocol** layer, the agent can autonomously perform complex **CRUD operations** and **automated data analysis** on game sales datasets. This project demonstrates how AI agents can transform traditional manual database administration into a conversational, insights-driven experience, enabling real-time trend reporting and seamless relational data handling.
